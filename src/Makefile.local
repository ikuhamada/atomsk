# Makefile for compiling Atomsk and installing it locally
# (i.e. in the user's home directory).
# All defaults are used (see main Makefile)
# except the installation path which is defined below.

# USAGE:
#    make -f Makefile.local

export 

# LAPACK="$(HOME)/local/lib/liblapack.a $(HOME)/local/lib/librefblas.a"

# Here we define the user's home directory as installation path.
# This way, the program atomsk will be installed in ~/bin/
# and the html documentation will be copied to ~/share/doc/atomsk/
INSTPATH=~
CONFPATH=~/.config

# Goto main Makefile
include Makefile
